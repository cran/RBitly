September 2015 - Smaller tweaks, which should not impact any functionality of the Bit.ly
               - Bring up-to-date with R releases
               - Added (a very) experimental support of Ow.ly (owned by Hootsuite.com). Please (!) report bugs to 
                 the maintainer (see above).
               - Added a (less experimental, but only partial) support of goo.gl (owned by Google.com). 
               - This is also the last release before RBitly will get achieved. Please replace with 
               devtools:install_github('dmpe/urlshorteneR')
